#"Everybody has creative potential, and from the moment you can express this creative potential, you can start changing the world. "-Paulo Coelho

#I am thrilled to share that I am a part of such an amazing "Explore AI 1.0 Hackathon" organised by Chitkara University, Punjab in collaboration with "Yamaha Motor Solutions India Pvt. Ltd."

#We collaborated on making an ML model which will be identifying curves where the dataset is being extracted from the pointcloud itself and will be further implementing it on real-world projects like race tracks, of which we are incredibly proud. 

#I want to thank the Yamaha Mentors, organisers, and experts for making this hackathon possible.

#"Machine learning is the last invention that humanity will ever need to make." â€”Nick Bostrom
